Thanks for checking out my Natural Ambience Pack!

# Audio Sources
I made sure to only use source audios of at least 256kb/s bit rate at 44.1khz to ensure a minimum quality level. The source sounds are a mixture of AI-generated, real and some synthesized audio that have been carefully selected, normalized, cleaned up and sometimes layered together to create natural sounding ambiences of various types.

# File Type & Quality
All sounds are designed to be perfectly loopable stereo 16 bit wave files, rendered with dithering.
The "stereo width" of the sounds are a mixture of very mono-sounding and very wide almost binaural sounding. Should you need the "monoify" any of the wider sounding sounds, you can use free tools like Audacity to do so, it's pretty straightforward.

# Other Formats
Should you need a different file format, I can recommend Audacity or ffmpeg (both free software) for conversion to other formats like ogg, mp3 etc.

# LICENSE
You are hereby granted a license to use these sounds in a commercial setting for one or more video game, video or other interactive media projects. Reselling or re-distribution of the sound files as-is is not granted.
